## About the Data

This data set was taken from the [Microsoft Malware Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction) competition run in 2019. "Microsoft is challenging the data science community to develop techniques to predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware. As with their previous, Malware Challenge (2015), Microsoft is providing Kagglers with an unprecedented malware dataset to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences."  

The raw training data set for the competition is very large: 8,921,483 observations (rows), and 83 features (variables), taking up 4.1 GB of space! 

In order to allow us to complete the tasks for this assignment in a reasonable amount of time, we took a very small subset of the entire train.csv data set -- just 10,000 rows (or about 0.1% of the entire training set). We skimmed off the top 10,000 rows from the data set for use in this project.
