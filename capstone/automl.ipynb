    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set was taken from the [Microsoft Malware Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction) competition run in 2019. \"Microsoft is challenging the data science community to develop techniques to predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware. As with their previous, Malware Challenge (2015), Microsoft is providing Kagglers with an unprecedented malware dataset to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "The raw training data set for the competition is very large: 8,921,483 observations (rows), and 83 features (variables), taking up 4.1 GB of space! \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to allow us to complete the tasks for this assignment in a reasonable amount of time, we took a very small subset of the entire train.csv data set -- just 10,000 rows (or about 0.1% of the entire training set). We skimmed off the top 10,000 rows from the data set for use in this project, and put it on our GitHub at 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tybyers/AZMLND_projects/capstone/capstone/data/train_1_10k.csv'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for this project is to predict whether a Windows machine is infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. Each row in this dataset corresponds to a machine, and has observations from telemetry data generated by WindowsDefender. The `HasDetections` column indicates that Malware was detected on the machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our 10,000 row data set, 4,950 machines have no malware detections, and 5,050 machines have malware detections. This is a nice, balanced data set.\n"
